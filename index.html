    If you change the ".html" to ".ipynb" in the url for any of these, you'll be able to download the original Jupyter notebook.

{% assign doclist = site.pages | sort: 'url'  %}
    <ul>
       {% for doc in doclist %}
            {% if doc.name contains '.html' && doc.name != 'index.html'%}
                <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ doc.url }}">{{ doc.name }}: {{ doc.date }}</a></li>
            {% endif %}
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
